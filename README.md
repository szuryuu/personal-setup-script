## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This is a personal automation script for fresh Arch Linux installations.
It works for my specific setup and preferences.

**Before running:**
1. Review all packages in `system-setup.sh`
2. Check if `archway` repo matches your config needs
3. Test in a VM first (recommended)
4. Have a backup plan if it fails

**Not responsible for:**
- Data loss
- Package conflicts
- Broken systems
- Lost time debugging

Use at your own risk. PR welcome for improvements.
